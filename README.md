# Simplentory
Simplentory is a simple "Inventory Management System".  
This is one of my first projects I ever made, so expect some bugs and poor code. Also, I heavily used ChatGPT to help me implement some features.

## Features

+ Set or change the Quantity of products
+ Set a custom name for your Simplentory instance

## How to Install
1. Clone the Repository.
2. Make sure that Node.js is installed. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/
3. Open a Terminal in the Project Folder.
4. Enter ```npm install``` in your Terminal. On Linux, you might need to use ```sudo npm install```.
5. Now, just run ```node index.js```! The database should be created automatically if you don't have one already. Again, on Linux you might need to run it with sudo.
6. Enter the IP of the computer Simplentory is running on. Your Simplentory instance should be up and running!

When you stop the server, just run ```node index.js``` to start it again.
